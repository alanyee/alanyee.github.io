  <p>
  In extrapolating an 
  <a href='http://www.chessgames.com/chessstats.html'>online chess database</a> 
  of 721,983 games, I have visualized a total sum of 
  112,073 games that make up the top thirty most common 
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame'>endgames</a> 
  — the chart on the left shows the remaining pieces for each side 
  when the game ends. Though since this data spans from 1475 to 2014, 
  this graph may  not be entirely pertinent for the modern metagame, 
  but still holds value for the history of chess and the game itself. 
  Also, since the database's average 
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system'>Elo ranking</a> 
  is 2199, any analysis here may not apply much for beginners or 
  novices, or any games between players with a significant difference in Elo.

  <p>
  Now then, this visualization holds many interesting details 
  just waiting to be dissected and analysed.

<h3><font color=#666>The Sustainability of Pieces</h3>
<div id='area2'></div>
<script src='js/data2.js'></script>
<div style='color: black'>
  <p>
  This graph shows a piece's sustainability — the likeliness 
  a piece will survive until the endgame. The king always 
  survive since that piece cannot be eaten, while none of the 
  common endgames ended with a second copy of a knight, bishop, 
  and rook. If you are winning, pawn are basically guaranteed to 
  have at least one pawn in your arsenal. If you have a rook, 
  your enemy is likely to have a rook; this applies vice versa, 
  and such a mirror scenario occurs for the players' possession of their 
  respective queens. Winning side has a little over 11% in sustainability 
  for their bishops than the losing side's, while the losing side's 
  is 8% more likely to live. This information speaks to the common 
  theory that bishops work better than knights, on their own, as 
  knights synergize with the movements and positions of the pawns, 
  and as the game progresses, both sides start losing their pawns.

<h4><font color=#666>The Difference in Point Advantage</h4>

<div id='area3'></div>
<script src='js/data3.js'></script>
<div style='color: black'>
  <p>
  The data also reveals that 
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece_relative_value#Standard_valuations'>
    points
  </a> 
  matter. In analysing the game of chess, past scholars have 
  made a standardized value system that nominates points for all 
  the pieces of the game. Pawns are worth 1 each, bishops and 
  knights are worth are 3 each, rooks are worth 5 each, the queen is
  worth 9, and the king is worth 1. So each player starts with 
  39 in total, and each lose points as each lose each's 
  respective pieces. The graph shows that the winning side 
  usually either 1 or 2 points ahead, or both sides are tied.
