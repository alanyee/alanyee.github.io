  In extrapolating an 
  <a href='http://www.chessgames.com/chessstats.html'>online chess database</a> 
  of 721,983 games, I have extracted a total sum of 
  112,073 games that make up the top thirty most common 
  <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame'>endgames</a> 
  â€” the remaining pieces for each side when the game ends.
  Basically, sustainability measures what pieces are still left by the endgame.
  The <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/King_(chess)'>king</a> always  survive since that piece cannot be eaten, while none of the 
  most common endgames ended with a second copy of a <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess)'>knight</a>, <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(chess)'>bishop</a>, 
  and <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Rook_(chess)'>rook</a>. If you are winning, at least one <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)'>pawn</a> is basically guaranteed to 
  have at least one pawn in your arsenal.
  Though since this data spans from 1475 to 2014, 
  this graph may  not be entirely pertinent for the modern metagame, 
  but still holds value for the history of chess and the game itself. 
  Also, since the database's average 
  <a href='https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system'>Elo rating</a> 
  is 2199, any analysis here may not apply much for beginners or 
  novices, or any games between players with a significant difference in Elo.

  Now then, this visualization holds many interesting details 
  just waiting to be dissected and analysed.
