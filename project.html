  In extrapolating an 
  <a href='http://www.chessgames.com/chessstats.html'>online chess database</a> 
  of 721,983 games, I have visualized a total sum of 
  112,073 games that make up the top thirty most common 
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame'>endgames</a> 
  â€” the chart on the left shows the remaining pieces for each side 
  when the game ends. Though since this data spans from 1475 to 2014, 
  this graph may  not be entirely pertinent for the modern metagame, 
  but still holds value for the history of chess and the game itself. 
  Also, since the database's average 
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system'>Elo ranking</a> 
  is 2199, any analysis here may not apply much for beginners or 
  novices, or any games between players with a significant difference in Elo.
  </p>
  <p>
  Now then, this visualization holds many interesting details 
  just waiting to be dissected and analysed.
