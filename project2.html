  The data also reveals that

    points
  </a> 
  matter. In analysing the game of chess, past scholars have 
  made a standardized value system that nominates points for all 
  the pieces of the game. Pawns are worth 1 each, bishops and 
  knights are worth are 3 each, rooks are worth 5 each, the queen is
  worth 9, and the king is worth 1. So each player starts with 
  39 in total, and each lose points as each lose each's 
  respective pieces. The graph shows that the winning side 
  usually either 1 or 2 points ahead, or both sides are tied.
