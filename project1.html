  This graph shows a piece's sustainability â€” the likeliness 
  a piece will survive until the endgame. The king always 
  survive since that piece cannot be eaten, while none of the 
  common endgames ended with a second copy of a knight, bishop, 
  and rook. If you are winning, pawn are basically guaranteed to 
  have at least one pawn in your arsenal. If you have a rook, 
  your enemy is likely to have a rook; this applies vice versa, 
  and such a mirror scenario occurs for the players' possession of their 
  respective queens. Winning side has a little over 11% in sustainability 
  for their bishops than the losing side's, while the losing side's 
  is 8% more likely to live. This information speaks to the common 
  theory that bishops work better than knights, on their own, as 
  knights synergize with the movements and positions of the pawns, 
  and as the game progresses, both sides start losing their pawns.
