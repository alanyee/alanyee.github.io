<h2><font color=#666>The Sustainability of Pieces</h2>

  <p>
  This graph shows a piece's sustainability â€” the likeliness 
  a piece will survive until the endgame. The king always 
  survive since that piece cannot be eaten, while none of the 
  most common endgames ended with a second copy of a knight, bishop, 
  and rook. If you are winning, at least one pawn is basically guaranteed to 
  have at least one pawn in your arsenal. If you have a rook, 
  your enemy is likely to have a rook; this applies vice versa, 
  and such a mirror scenario occurs for the players' possession of their 
  respective queens. Winning side tend to have more bishops than knights.
  This information reinforces the common theory that bishops work better than 
  knights, on their own, as knights synergize with the movements and positions of the pawns, 
  and as the game progresses, both sides start losing their pawns.
